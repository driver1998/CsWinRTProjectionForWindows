C#/WinRT projection for the `Windows.*` namespace.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to [Gustave Monce](https://github.com/gus33000) for making a `Windows.UI.Xaml` compatible fork of C#/WinRT (you can see it [here](https://github.com/gus33000/CsWinRT/tree/wux_refresh)).

This fork uses my [fork](https://github.com/driver1998/CsWinRT/tree/wux_notifychanged) of CsWinRT, which fixes support for INotifyPropertyChanged and INotifyCollectionChanged in System XAML / UWP.
